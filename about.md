Hi, my name is Joe. I live in London and I am, among other things, a professional software developer specialising in Python and Django. I've been doing things with computers since the 1980s, and developing professionally in Python since 2006.

I also dabble in various aspects of video production, and have written a few related bits and pieces in C / C++.

Until recently I was working for The World Food Programme, the world's largest humanitarian organization and winner of the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize.
