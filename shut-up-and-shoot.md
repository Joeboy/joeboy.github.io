I've decided to schedule some low-stakes, unplanned shoot days in the new year. I thought maybe I should come up with a bit of explanation and ground rules to set people's expectations. Here's some questions and answers:

## What's the idea here?

We'll schedule shoots. People will (hopefully) show up at the scheduled times in the allotted places, and spend the day creating a film together.

## What kinds of projects will we do?

It'll be up to whoever's directing on the day, but for example you could:

* Film a narrative short, shot with conventional angles / coverage, comprising dialogue written or improvised on the day
* Try some interesting technique you've been wanting to try but haven't found an excuse. Eg. something from [this book](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Master-Shots-Vol-2nd-Techniques/dp/1615930876/)
* Bring a scene from something you plan to film "properly", but want to try out a no-budget version of first

## Does everything have to be made up on the day?

Not at all, please bring ideas, even finished short scripts if you like! But also be prepared to work on somebody else's idea, and of course consider that whatever we do has to be doable by whoever shows up on the day.

## When will the shoots be?

Currently, the plan is 10am-6pm every other Saturday. If that doesn't seem to be working out we can rethink. First shoot will be Sunday January the 8th (because there's a rail strike on the Saturday). Of course, there's no requirement to show up for every shoot (I probably won't be doing that).

## Where will the shoots be?

At least for the first shoot, we can meet at my flat (address will be shared less publicly), and either film there or go out, or both. It's currently winter so being outdoors all day isn't ideal. Bring warm clothes.

## Who's in charge?

I might make some executive decisions about the group in general, but we'll collectively pick a director for each shoot day. They're in charge. Please be nice to them, respect their artistic choices, be a supportive collaborator, don't bombard them with unsolicited advice and opinions etc.

## What if not enough people show up?

If you have at least two people and a phone, you can do something. Shoot one of you wandering around the local area. Come up with a story. Find a quiet place and record a voiceover on your phone. Look for interesting shots, particularly ones that support your story. Find a suitable royalty free soundtrack and edit it all together. Or, do something completely different from that. My point is, you can do *something* even with a tiny crew.

## What if too many people show up?

If we get an unexpectedly good turnout, we'll split into teams. I reckon the optimal team for this sort of thing is something like 2-3 cast and 2-3 crew. 

## What about gear?

In general I think it makes sense to keep these shoots fairly low-tech, we don't need big lighting setups, cranes etc. By all means bring exciting gear if you want to play with it. Be aware that anything too conspicuous will attract attention when filming anywhere public. I have adequate kit for one shoot, if I'm not around people will need to be self-sufficient. A decent phone camera will do for the visuals (but by all means bring a camera if you want to shoot with it). Audio is a bit trickier.

## What about editing?

I can do some, but other people will also have to come forward and offer to edit. We're not going to be making Citizen Kane, the important thing is that it gets done, so people can get an idea of what worked and what didn't. If you're opinionated about the edit, please consider editing yourself rather than making demands of whoever else volunteered. It's fine if we end up with more than one edit. Please share footage etc nicely.

## How seriously are we taking this?

Let's make our best effort at creating something good. Let's try to maintain a focused and disciplined set. But let's also keep a sense of perspective, and not be dicks about it if things don't go the way we'd like. There's always next time.

## Anything else?

Be humble. Don't be a dick. Don't try to make anybody do anything that makes them feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Have fun.
