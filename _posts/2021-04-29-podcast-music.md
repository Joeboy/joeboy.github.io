Ages ago a mate asked me if I could do some intro / outro music for his new podcast, [Polling Politics](https://audioboom.com/channels/4958359). I just noticed they dropped their first new episode since 2019, which you can listen to [here](https://audioboom.com/posts/7854634-wales-watching-with-roger-awan-scully-and-lauren-mcevatt) if you want to listen to people talk about Welsh politics, bookended by a few seconds of music by me.

Around the same time I also did some bits of '80s pastiche music for a podcast called [Ghosts on the Dance Floor](https://soundcloud.com/michael-hall-964148813/the-bell-ghosts-on-the-dance-floor), about The Bell, "an iconic lesbian and gay pub of the 80s and 90s". It was great to have the freedom to be cheesy and derivative.
