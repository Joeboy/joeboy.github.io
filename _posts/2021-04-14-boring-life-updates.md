Until recently I was developing software for The World Food Programme, the world's largest humanitarian organisation and the winner of the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. The work I was doing there is currently suspended due to COVID-19 issues, so I'm potentially available for work. I'm based in London, open to remote or office-based (a combination would be nice), not looking for full-time permanent but interested in part time or temporary contracts. Ideally nothing too evil.

Aside from that, I'm trying to buy a flat, eating too much, going on long walks in an effort to counter that, and generally keeping busy. I just watched WandaVision, which I thought was great for the first few episodes but turned into boring flyey shootey MCU mush towards the end.
