Hi there!

My former web host had a catastrophic crash that deleted all my files. Being a pro I had backups, but the content was mostly old and a bit embarrassing so I figure it's a good time to start afresh. There's a good chance I'll be no better at updating this blog than the last one, but we'll see. If I'm completely honest, my immediate goal is just to make it so my domain name doesn't resolve to my DNS host's holding page.

For people who are interested in that sort of thing, this blog is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
